#Introduction

In SQL, JOIN operations are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. These operations allow for querying data spread across multiple tables effectively, by retrieving related data.

#Joins

SQL JOINs are used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on related columns. They enable combining rows from two or more tables based on a common field.

#Types of joins

1. INNER JOIN: Combines rows from both tables where there is a match in the joining column.


2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. Rows from the left table with no match in the right table will show NULL for columns from the right table.


3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table. Rows from the right table with no match in the left table will show NULL for columns from the left table.


4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN): Combines the result of both LEFT and RIGHT JOINs. It includes all rows from both tables, with NULLs where there are no matches.
